# Database Seeding â€“ Airbnb Clone Project

This script (`seed.sql`) adds realistic sample data to the Airbnb database.

## Sample Data Includes:
- Two users (guest and host)
- One property linked to the host
- One booking made by the guest
- One payment for the booking
- One review by the guest
- One message exchanged between users

The seed data helps test key database operations and validate business logic in the application.
