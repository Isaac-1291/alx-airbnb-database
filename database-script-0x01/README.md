- Uses `UUID` for primary keys
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity
- ENUM-like constraints (CHECK) on roles, status, and methods
- Proper use of timestamps and indexing

## ðŸ“Œ Indexes Added

- `email` for fast user lookup
- `location` for property filtering
- `user_id` and `booking_id` for performance in JOINs
